# molecular-electronics
Mostly fortran code from my research time (between 2007 and 2014) in the field of molecular electronics.

## MTDec
Decoherent quantum transport for multiterminal devices.

## Transdec
Computes the electronic transmittancy of some bidimensional molecules: the code is strongly suited for polyanilines.
transdec.sh is a bash facility program to recompile and send desktop notifications about the program status.

## ICRDM
Grupo de programas y scripts para calcular las propiedades electricas de cadenas tight-binding.	

## nmrPani
NMR related programs for PANI

## fiscomp
A collection of codes for 'typical' case use problems in Computational Physics.

## decinvert
Just a proof of concept: Invert a matrix by the method of decimation.

## DecCAFin
Proof of Concept: Decoherence in electronic transport using "finite" decoherent leads.
